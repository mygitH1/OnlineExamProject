    <b>Online Exam</b> means the candidate sits in front of a computer at the examination centre and the questions
     are presented on the computer monitor and the candidate answers the questions on the computer through the
     use of mouse. Unlike the traditional paper pencil based test which is generally offered on a single day to
     all candidates, Online Exam will be offered over a period of time and the candidate can choose the Center,
     the Day and Time of his/her convenience to take the test. 
<br/><br/>
	<b>Online Exam Pattern:</b>
	<br/><br/>
		No marks are awarded for questions not attempted. While the candidate can skip a question, the computer
	will not allow the candidate to choose more than one option as correct answer. 
	<br/><br/>
		There will be 5 questions in all. The questions are so designed that a good candidate will be able to 
	answer 5 questions in 10 minutes.
